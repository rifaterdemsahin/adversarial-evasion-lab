An **`.ipynb`** file stands for **I**nteractive **Py**thon **N**ote**b**ook (now officially called a **Jupyter Notebook**).

Think of it as a **digital lab notebook**. Instead of just having a file full of code (like a standard `.py` script), a notebook allows you to mix three things together in one document:

1.  **Live Code:** You can write code in small blocks (called "cells") and run them one at a time.
2.  **Visualizations:** Graphs, images, and tables appear directly below the code that generated them.
3.  **Narrative Text:** You can write formatted text (headers, bold, lists) to explain what the code is doing.



### Why use it for your Coursera course?
* **Step-by-Step Teaching:** You can run the code one block at a time (e.g., "First, let's load the data," then "Now, let's train the model") which is perfect for a screen recording.
* **Instant Feedback:** You see the "Clean vs. Adversarial" image immediately after running the cell, which looks great on video.

### How to use it
In your **GitHub Codespaces** environment, you just double-click the `M1_V1_FGSM.ipynb` file. The interface will automatically load, allowing you to click the **"Play"** button next to each cell to execute the code.

Would you like a quick checklist of the buttons you'll need to press in the Codespaces interface during your recording?
